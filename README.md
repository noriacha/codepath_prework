## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most challenging thing I encountered while building the app was navigating through Swift. I encountered difficulties when attempting to incorporate a new file and adapting to its distinct syntax. Despite the difficulties, overcoming this obstacle greatly enhanced my programming skills and boosted my confidence in app development.

Potential App Idea 1:
 
 Design a memory game where users need to match pairs of cards. You can have different levels of difficulty and track the number of moves and time taken to complete the game.

Potential App Idea 2:

Develop a trivia quiz app with different categories of questions. Users can choose a category and answer multiple-choice questions. You can keep track of their scores and even implement a high-score system.
