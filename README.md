## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The most challenging thing I encountered while building the app was navigating through Swift. I encountered difficulties when attempting to incorporate a new file and adapting to its distinct syntax. Despite the difficulties, overcoming this obstacle greatly enhanced my programming skills and boosted my confidence in app development.
